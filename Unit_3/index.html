	<h2>New Blog...Who Dis?</h2>

	<p>Becoming a dad in 2018 does not mean you have shed your entire identity and become someone new. As I get closer to that life changing moment where I become responsible for another human, I can't help but think of all the cool stuff I would like to show my first born, while still maintaining my own sense of self. What does that look like as we head towards the due date? No effing idea. </p>
